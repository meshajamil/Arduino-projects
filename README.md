How to create Range measurer, area and distance calculator using arduino

When clicked, it will toggle from distance to area. 
You can get the components needed for this project from the links below:

Ultrasonic Sensor
MPU6050 3 Axis Gyroscope Accelerometer
16Ã—2 Character LCD
Arduino Nano
1 5ohms resister
1 push button

Connect 5ohms one side with a push button and the other with VCC of transonic sensor. 2nd pin and 2nd last pin of of the LCD, 5V of arduino Nano, and VCC of accelorometer
Connect GND with push button left side and and connect to ultra sonic sensor GND. Connect with 1st 5th and the last pin Of LCD and, GND of Accelerometer
The Ultrasonic trig to be pinned with D8 of arduino 
Echo of Ultrasonic with D8 of arduino
Scl with A5 and SDA with A4 of arduino with Accelerometer
3rd pin of LCD with 5V and GND
9V battery with arduino VN and GND respectively
4th pin of LCD with D7 of arduino
6th pin of LCD with D6 of arduino
6th last pin of LCD with D5 or arduino
3rd last pin of LCD with D2 of arduino
5th last pin of LCD with D4 of arduino
4th last pin of LCD with D3 of arduino.
